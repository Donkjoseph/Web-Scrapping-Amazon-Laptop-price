# Web-Scrapping-Amazon-Laptop-price

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Using Python's Beautiful Soup library, you can scrape data from Amazon, such as laptop prices, to analyze and gather information. The process involves sending an HTTP request to the Amazon webpage, parsing the HTML content using Beautiful Soup, and then locating the specific HTML elements that contain the desired information (e.g., laptop names and prices). This data can be extracted and stored for further use, such as price comparison, trend analysis, or market research.

Note: Scraping websites like Amazon can violate their terms of service. Additionally, Amazon employs anti-scraping measures, so it is essential to adhere to legal and ethical standards when web scraping.
